As a client, at the first time you got a token. You have 2 options:
a. save the token locally (for example in a file or in SP)
b. use this token only in this current app-launch, and re-request a token from the server each time the app launches again.

implementation a:

*pro: when we save the token locally, we avoid asking it from the server every time, which is an expensive request 
The user is waiting and asking the server and waiting for the answer takes time.
*con: if we save the user token for reuse we are risking our users, because someone might get access to this token
and can use our user information.

implamantation b:

*pro: less risk for stealing our user information since we do not save the token.
*cons: expensive request each time, makes the user wait to get the requested information.
